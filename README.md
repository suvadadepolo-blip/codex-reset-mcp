# Codex Reset MCP server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/suvadadepolo/codex-reset)](https://smithery.ai/servers/suvadadepolo/codex-reset)

Read-only facts about OpenAI Codex usage-limit resets, served by [codex-reset.com](https://codex-reset.com/) over the Model Context Protocol.

- **Endpoint:** `https://codex-reset.com/mcp`
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0, protocol `2025-06-18`. POST only; a GET answers 405.
- **Auth:** none. No API key, no sign-up, no session.
- **Cost:** free, with credit (see [Terms](#terms)).
- **Docs:** [codex-reset.com/developers](https://codex-reset.com/developers) · [server card](https://codex-reset.com/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json) · [llms.txt](https://codex-reset.com/llms.txt)

This repository holds the client configuration and directory metadata for the hosted server. There is nothing to install or run: the server lives at the endpoint above, and its source is not published here.

## Tools

All three tools are read-only (`readOnlyHint: true`) and read the same data as the site's public JSON API, so an agent and a browser never disagree.

| Tool | Returns | Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `get_reset_forecast` | Probability of a Codex usage-limit reset in the next 24 and 48 hours, confidence, the last confirmed reset and any active official signal. A forecast, not a promise. | `locale` |
| `get_reset_timeline` | Dated record of verified resets and related announcements, newest first, each with its source URL. | `group` (`reset` \| `boost` \| `unlock` \| `credits`), `from`, `to` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `limit` (1–50, default 10), `locale` |
| `get_codex_status` | Current Codex service state, to tell an outage apart from a usage limit. | `locale` |

`locale` is `en`, `zh`, `ja` or `es` and changes only the human-readable copy.

## Example prompts

- "Is Codex likely to reset its usage limits in the next 24 hours?"
- "When was the last verified Codex usage-limit reset, and where was it announced?"
- "List every Codex reset from August 2026 with its source link."
- "I'm getting errors in Codex. Is that an outage or did I hit my usage limit?"
- "Should I wait for a reset or keep working? Check the forecast and the service status."
